## 📖 Overview

**PhishGuard AI** is a machine learning-based security tool designed to detect and classify phishing emails. By analyzing email content (subject lines and body text) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this model identifies potential security threats with high accuracy.

This project was built to demonstrate the application of AI in cybersecurity, focusing on feature extraction, text preprocessing, and classification algorithms.
